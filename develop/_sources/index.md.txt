## BiPMo â€“ Biogas Plant Model

BiPMo (Biogas Plant Model) is a simulation framework for the optimized operation of a biogas plant in a given scenario that works in combination with the simulation environment [FLEDGE](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715873).

The model is organized and implemented based on the flexible building model [CoBMo](https://zenodo.org/record/3523539). 

## Features
- Simulation of biogas production given different parameters
    - Anaerobic digestion based on based on the work in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.12.073 and ISBN: 978-3-319-16192-1 
- Optimal plant operation over a given planning horizon based on price timeseries
- Support of a simple model with constant biogas production and a flexible biogas plant model with flexible feeding regime
