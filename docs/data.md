FLEDGE scenarios are defined through CSV files, where each CSV file represents a table as defined below (the file name is interpreted as the table name). Internally, FLEDGE loads all CSV files into a local SQLITE database for more convenient processing. The default location for FLEDGE scenario definitions is in the `data` directory in the repository and all CSV files in the `data` directory are automatically loaded into the database. The CSV files may be structured into sub-directories, but all files are eventually combined into the same database. Hence, all type / element identifiers must be unique across all scenario definitions.

| `der_type` | | DER type selector. Choices: `fixed_load`, `flexible_load`, `fixed_generator`, `flexible_generator`, `fixed_ev_charger`, `cooling_plant`, `storage`. Note: `flexible_buildings` cannot be defined here, because it is obtained from the CoBMo submodule directly. |
| `der_model_name` | | Unique DER model identifier (must only be unique within the associated DER type). |
| `definition_type` | | Definition type selector, because most DER types require either additional timeseries / schedule definition¹ or other supplementary parameter definitions from either of the tables `der_timeseries`, `der_schedules` or `der_cooling_plants`.

If `definition_type` is `timeseries` or `timeseries_per_unit`: defined in `der_timeseries`; if `definition_type` is `schedule` or `schedule_per_unit`: defined in `der_schedules`; if `definition_type` is `cooling_plant`: defined in `der_cooling_plants`. |

| `charging_efficiency` | - | Energy storage charging efficiency factor. |
| `self_discharge_rate` | 1/h | Energy storage self discharge rate. |
| `marginal_cost` | $/kWh | Marginal cost of power generation. *Currently, prices / costs are assumed to be in SGD.* |

For most DER types, the `der_models` table is supplemented by timeseries / schedule definitions in the tables `der_timeseries` / `der_schedules` or supplementary parameter definitions in `der_cooling_plants` based on the columns `definition_type` / `definition_name`. Furthermore, each DER type relies on a different subset of columns / parameters in `der_models`. The table below outlines the required supplementary definitions for as well as the required columns for each DER type:

| DER type | Description | Required columns | Required supplementary definitions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fixed_load` | Fixed load, following a fixed demand timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `flexible_load` | Flexible load, following a demand timeseries, but able shift a share of its nominal load, limited by its energy storage capacity. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `energy_storage_capacity_per_unit` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `fixed_generator` | Fixed generator, following a fixed generation timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `marginal_cost` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `flexible_generator` | Flexible generator, dispatchable within given limits and based on a generation timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `marginal_cost` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `fixed_ev_charger` | Fixed EV charger, following a fixed demand timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `cooling_plant` | Cooling plant, converts electric power to thermal power, dispatchable with nominal power limits. | `definition_type`, `definition_name` | Cooling plant parameters according to `der_cooling_plants`. |
| `storage` | Energy storage, can charge / discharge within given limits and based on its energy storage capacity. | `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `energy_storage_capacity_per_unit`, `charging_efficiency`, `self_discharge_rate` | N.A. |

The selection of DER types will be extended in the future. Note that the DER type `flexible_buildings` is not defined here, instead the model definition is obtained from the Control-oriented Building Model (CoBMo) submodule.

Not all DER types can be connected to all grid types, e.g. `fixed_ev_charger` is only available in the electric grid. Refer to `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders` to check which DER types can be connected respectively.

¹ For DER types which require the definition of timeseries values, these can be defined either directly as a timeseries or as a schedule, where the latter describes recurring schedules based on weekday / time of day (see `der_schedules`).

² Active / reactive / thermal power values can be defined as absolute values or in per unit values. Per unit values are assumed to be in per unit of the nominal active / reactive power as defined `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders`. Note that the sign of the active / reactive / thermal power values in the timeseries / schedule definition are ignored and superseded by the sign of the nominal active / reactive / thermal power value as defined in `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders`, where positive values are interpreted as generation and negative values as consumption. Additionally, note that `der_timeseries` / `der_schedules` only define a single power value for each timestep. Thus, for electric DERs the active power is derived directly based on the value in `der_timeseries` / `der_schedules` and the reactive power is calculated from the active power assuming a fixed power factor according to the nominal active / reactive power in `electric_grid_ders`.

### `der_timeseries`

Note that the daily schedule is repeated for any weekday greater than or equal to `dd` until the next defined `dd`. The initial value for each schedule must start at `time_period = 01T00:00`.
